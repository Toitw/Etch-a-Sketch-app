# Etch-a-Sketch-app
Etch a Sketch aplication
This is a project part of the Odin Project Curriculum.
The objective is to create a small etch-a-sketch aplication with some features needed:
- It must contain at least 16x16 squares and must be able to increase it to 64x64
- It must have a hover effect so the squares change when the mouse goes over
- It must have an option to change the color to "multicolor" (Random RGB)
- It must reset when you change the square configuration number
